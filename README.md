## Getting Started

Follow instructions below to have a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your system

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), a JavaScript runtime that lets you run applications outside the browser
- NPM, a package manager for Nodejs software packages (Comes with Node)
- MongoDB installation 
- [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) account (Test account will work)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for image uploads
- [Sendgrid](sendgrid.com) account

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/JaymesKat/online-shop.git
```

Navigate into root of repository

```
cd online-shop
```

Install application dependencies

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and populate following variables

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<sendgrid-api-key>
MONGO_DB_URI=<mongodb-connection-uri>
STRIPE_SECRET=<stripe-secret>
STRIPE_KEY=<stripe-api-key>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<cloudinary-cloud-name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<cloudinary-api-key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<cloudinary-api-secret>
```

*NB:* The `MONGO_DB_URI` should be populated to configure the app with a database. I recommend setting up one on [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) which is easy to setup and provides a free tier.

## Running the application

Run the command below in the project's root folder
```
npm start
```
